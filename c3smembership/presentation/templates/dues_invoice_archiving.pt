                <!--!
                    Unfortunately, the internationalization parsing has issues
                    with the smaller than sign "<" in the condition
                    "len(invoices) < count" as it interprets it as a tag opening
                    sign without any tag name. To solve this issue, the positive
                    boolean condition is replaced by its negative.

                    len(invoices) < count  <=>  not (len(invoices) >= count)
                -->
                <div tal:condition="not (len(invoices) >= count)" tal:omit-tag="">
