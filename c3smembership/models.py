"""
This module holds the database models for c3sMembership.

Unit and functional tests for the code are in tests/test_models.py.
Other functional and integration tests can be found throughout the
other bits of tests and code relying on or using these models.

The classes below represent the database tables.
It is actually a SQLAlchemy model.

Classes / Data Objects:

* **Groups** (Roles for Users)
* **C3sStaff** (backend login people, administration)
* **Shares** (packages -- members can hold packages of shares)
* **C3sMember** (members .. or applications to become members)
* **Dues15Invoice** (membership dues, 2015 edition)
